# Working With Sonner

> Vendored from Emil Kowalski's [`ask-sonner`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/main/skills/ask-sonner) at `d16ebe6` (MIT). Studio handling in [catalog.md](catalog.md#sonner) still applies: toasts take project tokens, not supplier defaults.

A guide skill for [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski), the toast library. When a task involves Sonner — wiring it up, rendering toasts, styling them, or fixing them — answer from this file first. Full prop tables for `<Toaster />` and `toast()` live in [API reference](#api-reference) below; read it when you need an exact prop name, type, or default.

## Setup

Two pieces, and only two:

1. **One `<Toaster />`, mounted once**, as close to the root as possible (in Next.js: `layout.tsx` — it works inside server components). Never render it per-page or conditionally; a second mounted Toaster duplicates every toast.
2. **`toast()` called from client code** — event handlers, effects, callbacks. It's a plain function, no hook or provider needed, but it does nothing on the server: in a server action, return the result and call `toast()` in the client code that receives it.

```jsx
import { Toaster } from 'sonner'; // once, in layout
import { toast } from 'sonner';   // anywhere client-side
```

## Picking the right call

| You want | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Plain message | `toast('Title')` — add `{ description }` for a second line |
| Success / error / info / warning icon | `toast.success('…')`, `toast.error('…')`, etc. |
| Spinner while you manage state yourself | `toast.loading('…')`, then update it by id |
| Loading → success/error tied to a promise | `toast.promise(promise, { loading, success, error })` — success/error accept functions receiving the resolved value/error |
| Button that does something | `{ action: { label, onClick } }` — closes the toast unless `onClick` calls `event.preventDefault()`; `cancel` is the secondary variant |
| Custom JSX, default toast shell | `toast(<jsx />)` |
| Custom JSX, no styles at all | `toast.custom((t) => <jsx />)` — headless, `t` gives you the id to dismiss |

## Recipes

**Update a toast** — call `toast()` again with the same `id`; only the props you pass change. Switching to `toast.success(…, { id })` changes the type. This is how loading → success flows work without `toast.promise`:

```jsx
const id = toast.loading('Uploading…');
toast.success('Uploaded', { id });
```

**Persist** — `{ duration: Infinity }`. **Dismiss** — `toast.dismiss(id)`, or `toast.dismiss()` for all. **Read active toasts** — `useSonner()` in React, `toast.getActiveToasts()` outside it.

**Links or components in the text** — pass a function for the title or description: `toast(() => <a href="…">View</a>)`.

**Multiple toasters** — give each an `id` and target with `toast('…', { toasterId: 'canvas' })`. Without `toasterId`, every toaster renders the toast.

**Close callbacks** — `onDismiss` fires on close button or swipe; `onAutoClose` fires on timeout. They are separate; there is no single "closed" callback.

## Styling — the escalation ladder

Climb only as far as the change requires; jumping to the top rung too early is fine (it's the recommended end state), lingering in the middle is not.

1. **Defaults** — plus `richColors` on the Toaster for colorful success/error, `invert` to flip against the theme.
2. **Inline tweaks** — `toastOptions={{ style: {…} }}` on the Toaster for all toasts, or `style` per `toast()` call.
3. **Classes on parts** — `toastOptions={{ classNames: { toast, title, description, actionButton, cancelButton, closeButton } }}`. Sonner's injected styles win the cascade, so every class needs `!important` (Tailwind: `!text-red-900`). If you're marking more than a few things important, stop — go headless.
4. **Headless** — `toast.custom()` with your own JSX, keeping Sonner's positioning, stacking, and swipe. The recommended approach for a design-system toast: wrap it in your own `toast()` abstraction. (`unstyled: true` exists as a halfway house, but headless gives more control for the same effort.)

**Icons** — swap defaults per-type with the Toaster's `icons` prop, per-toast with `icon`, remove with `null`.

**Theme** — `theme` defaults to `'light'` and does not track the OS. Pass `theme="system"`, or wire your theme provider: `<Toaster theme={resolvedTheme} />` from `next-themes`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
| --- | --- |
| Toast never appears | No `<Toaster />` mounted, or it unmounted (conditional render, per-page placement). Mount one at the root. If calling from a server action: `toast()` is client-only — call it with the action's result on the client. |
| Same toast appears twice | Two Toasters mounted (layout **and** page) — keep one. Or `toast()` fired in an effect under React StrictMode's dev double-invoke — fire from the event handler instead, or pass a stable `id` so the second call updates rather than duplicates. |
| Tailwind/CSS classes have no effect | Default styles override them. Mark them `!important`, or use `unstyled` / headless (see the ladder above). |
| Toasts render completely unstyled (common in Astro, view transitions) | Sonner's injected stylesheet was lost — import it explicitly in a layout: `import 'sonner/dist/styles.css'`. |
| Unstyled inside Shadow DOM | Styles land in `document.head`, not the shadow root. Copy the style tag whose text includes `[data-sonner-toaster]` into the shadow root. |
| Toast behind a modal/overlay, or clipped | An ancestor creates a stacking context (`transform`, `filter`, `overflow`) or the overlay out-z-indexes the toaster. Move `<Toaster />` to the document root, outside any dialog/portal container. |
| Dark mode ignored | `theme` defaults to `'light'` — set `theme="system"` or pass the resolved theme (see Theme above). |
| Success/error look gray, not green/red | That's the default. Add `richColors` to the Toaster. |
| Toast never closes | `duration: Infinity`, `dismissible: false`, or a `toast.promise` whose promise never settles — the loading toast waits forever. |
| `toast.promise` stuck on loading | It needs a promise (or a function returning one) as its first argument, and the promise must actually resolve/reject. |
| Swipe-to-dismiss goes the wrong way / doesn't work | Directions derive from `position`. Override with `swipeDirections` on the Toaster. |
| Toast shows up in every toaster | Multiple toasters need targeting: give each Toaster an `id` and pass `toasterId` in the `toast()` call. |
| Toasts too close to the screen edge on mobile | `offset` (desktop, default 32px) and `mobileOffset` (<600px, default 16px) — numbers, CSS strings, or per-side objects. |

## API reference

Exact props, types, and defaults. Options passed to `toast()` override the same options set via the Toaster's `toastOptions`.

### `<Toaster />`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `string` | `'light'` | `'light'`, `'dark'`, or `'system'`. |
| `richColors` | `boolean` | `false` | Makes error and success states more colorful. |
| `expand` | `boolean` | `false` | Toasts expanded by default (otherwise they expand on hover). |
| `visibleToasts` | `number` | `3` | Amount of visible toasts. |
| `id` | `string` | – | Toaster id, targeted by `toast()`'s `toasterId` option. |
| `position` | `string` | `'bottom-right'` | `top-left`, `top-center`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-center`, `bottom-right`. |
| `closeButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Adds a close button to all toasts. |
| `offset` | `string \| number \| object` | `'32px'` | Offset from screen edges. Object form is per-side: `{ bottom: '24px', right: '16px' }`. |
| `mobileOffset` | `string \| number \| object` | `'16px'` | Offset when screen width < 600px. |
| `swipeDirections` | `array` | based on position | Allowed swipe-to-dismiss directions. |
| `dir` | `string` | `'ltr'` | Text directionality. |
| `hotkey` | `string` | `⌥/alt + T` | Keyboard shortcut that focuses the toaster area. |
| `invert` | `boolean` | `false` | Dark toasts in light mode and vice versa. |
| `toastOptions` | `object` | – | Default options applied to every toast (any `toast()` option below). |
| `gap` | `number` | `14` | Gap between toasts when expanded. |
| `icons` | `object` | – | Replace default icons: `{ success, info, warning, error, loading }`; `null` removes one. |

### `toast()` options

`toast(message, options)` — message is a string, JSX, or a function returning JSX. Returns the toast's id.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | `ReactNode` | – | Renders underneath the title; also accepts a function returning JSX. |
| `closeButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Adds a close button. |
| `invert` | `boolean` | `false` | Dark toast in light mode and vice versa. |
| `duration` | `number` | `4000` | Milliseconds before auto-close. `Infinity` persists the toast. |
| `position` | `string` | `'bottom-right'` | Position of this toast. |
| `dismissible` | `boolean` | `true` | If `false`, the user cannot dismiss the toast. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | – | Icon in front of the text; `null` removes the default. |
| `action` | `ReactNode \| { label, onClick }` | – | Primary button; clicking closes the toast unless `onClick` calls `event.preventDefault()`. |
| `cancel` | `ReactNode \| { label, onClick }` | – | Secondary button; clicking closes the toast. |
| `actionButtonStyle` | `object` | `{}` | Styles for the action button. |
| `cancelButtonStyle` | `object` | `{}` | Styles for the cancel button. |
| `id` | `string` | – | Custom id; calling `toast()` again with the same id updates the existing toast. |
| `testId` | `string` | – | Rendered as `data-testid` for e2e tests. |
| `toasterId` | `string` | – | Id of the toaster to render this toast in. |
| `style` | `object` | – | Inline styles for the toast. |
| `classNames` | `object` | – | Classes per part: `{ toast, title, description, actionButton, cancelButton, closeButton }`. Needs `!important` unless `unstyled`. |
| `unstyled` | `boolean` | `false` | Removes all default styles. |
| `onDismiss` | `(toast) => void` | – | Fires when the close button is clicked or the toast is swiped away. |
| `onAutoClose` | `(toast) => void` | – | Fires when the toast closes automatically after `duration`. |
| `containerAriaLabel` | `string` | `'Notifications'` | ARIA label for the toast container. |

### Functions

| Function | Purpose |

| `toast.dismiss(id?)` | Dismiss one toast, or all when called without an id. |
| `toast.getActiveToasts()` | All active toasts, usable outside React. |
| `useSonner()` | React hook returning `{ toasts }`. |
